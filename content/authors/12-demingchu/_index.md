I (Deming CHU, 储德明) am a second year PhD student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wale. My supervisor is Prof. Wenjie Zhang and Prof. Ying Zhang. Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree from East China Normal University in 2017, and my M.Eng. degree from the same school in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Xuemin Lin.

I am interested in designing scalable algorithms for massive graphs. Currently, I work on Graph Data Management with a focus on Cohesive Subgraph Mining.
