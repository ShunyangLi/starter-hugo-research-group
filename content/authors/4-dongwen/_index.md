I am a lecturer at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). I received my Ph.D. degree in 2019 from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree from the Nankai University, China in 2013. I had worked as a postdoctoral research fellow from 2019 to 2021 at UTS and joined UNSW in 2021.
