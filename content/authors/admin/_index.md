Xuemin Lin is a UNSW Scientia Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales. Currently, he is the head of data and knowledge research group in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW. Xuemin is a fellow of IEEE. Xuemin got his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Queensland (Australia) in 1992 and his BSc in Applied Math from Fudan University (China) in 1984. During 1984-1988, he studied for PhD in Applied Math at Fudan University.

Xuemin started his teaching in the Computer Science Department at the University of Western Australia in Nov 1994 after a 2 years research fellow appointment at the University of Queensland. He joined the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales in Nov 1997. In 2005, he was a visiting researcher in Microsoft Asia Research Lab and visited Tokyo University as a JSPS fellow. He is a distinguished visiting Professor at Tsinghua University and a visiting Chair Professor at Fudan University. He has been an adiunct Professor at East Normal University, Zhejiang Gongshang University, and Guangzhou University. Xuemin currently is the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. an Associate Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. He was an associate editor of ACM Transactions on Database Systems (2008-2014) and an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (2013 Feb - 2015 Jan).

His teaching covered a quite range of courses at different leveles. He also supervised many graduate students. Xuemin Lin's principal research areas are databases and graph visualisation .

- In databases, his research areas include data mining, data streams, distributed database systems, spatial database systems, and web databases. Currently, he is working on data streams,, approximate query processing, spatial data processing , probabilistic queries, Graph Databases , and web information processing.

- Graph visualisation is to display a graph according to the aesthetics from applications; for example, one may wish to draw a graph symmetrically if possible. Graph visualisation serves as a tool in many applications. A number of topics have been covered by Xuemin in graph drawing, which include drawing trees, undirected graphs, directed graphs, and hierarchical graphs. Xuemin's main focus has been on understanding inherent difficulties of drawing problems, and then developing effective drawing algorithms.
