I'm a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at UNSW, Sydney, Australia.

My research falls under the broad area of data/information/knowledge management, including: data modelling, query processing, access structures, multimedia retrieval, web search, information extraction, text mining. Currently, I'm working on a project in modelling, building, maintaining and managing research-related data (RAM: research area mapper). I also work on education-related projects, including: the use of online role-play in education ([ORE](http://webapps.cse.unsw.edu.au/ore/)), curriculum mapping tools ([CMap](https://webapps.cse.unsw.edu.au/cmap/user/home.php)), a course management system ([WebCMS](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/)) which is used by many courses in CSE.
