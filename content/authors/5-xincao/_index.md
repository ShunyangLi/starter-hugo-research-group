I am a senior lecturer (equivalent to a tenured position in the North American system) in the School of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at The University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia. I am also currently an ARC DECRA Fellow (awarded in 2018). I had worked as a lecturer in the Knowledge and Data Engineering research cluster within the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Queenâ€™s University Belfast (QUB) in UK from 2014 to 2016.

I did my PhD study in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University from August 2010 to October 2014, under the supervision of Prof. Gao Cong. Prior to joining NTU, I was a scientific assistant in the Center for Data-Intensive Systems at Aalborg University from September 2008 to June 2010, under the supervision of Prof. Christian S. Jensen and Prof. Gao Cong. I obtained my Master and Bachelor degrees from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China, in June 2008 and June 2006, respectively.
