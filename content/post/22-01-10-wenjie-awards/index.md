Congratulations to Professor Wenjie Zhang for winning Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (FT210100303): Efficient and Scalable Processing of Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs, $1,085,000.

<!--more-->

Professor Wenjie Zhang, UNSW Engineering, has received $1,085,000 for ‘Efficient and scalable processing of dynamic heterogeneous graphs’. The project aims to develop efficient and scalable algorithms to process large-scale dynamic heterogeneous graphs where graph nodes and edges are of multiple types and the graph structure updates dynamically. Anticipated outcomes include novel computing paradigms, algorithms, indexing, incremental computation, distributed algorithms as well as a system prototype to demonstrate the practical value. The project’s success will benefit many key applications in Australia including cybersecurity, e-commerce, health and social networks.
